# Notebook Descriptions

This folder contains four Jupyter Notebooks designed to streamline the training, testing, inference, and visualization of our approach for learning depth from event-camera data. The functionality provided in these notebooks is also available as standalone Python files, to be run directly after adjusting for the paths of directories. However, the notebooks contain additional explanations to guide users toward an intuitive understanding of the code and its functionality.

### 1. Classes_and_Functions
This notebook defines essential components for training and inference:
- **Dataset Class**: Defines the dataset used for training and testing, with a streamlined version for inference.
- **Neural Network Definition**: Contains the architecture of the neural network.
- **Training and Testing Functions**: Includes functions to handle the network's training and testing.
- **Performance Metrics Function**: Provides a function to compute performance metrics for evaluating model accuracy and efficiency.

### 2. Training_and_Testing
This notebook enables training the network, either from scratch or by continuing from a pretrained model. It also supports testing the network’s performance. The notebook is configured to run as is, requiring only directory path adjustments. All available options and configurations are explained in detail within the notebook.

### 3. Inference
This notebook enables inference on trained networks. It provides depth estimates for all frames in the specified dataset and includes options for visualizing these estimates. Inference time is also measured for performance analysis.

### 4. Visualization
In this notebook, a video can be generated for a chosen sequence, displaying:
- **True Depths**
- **Network Depth Estimates** on a denser filter
- **Argmax Depth Estimates** on both the original pixel set and the denser filter

These visualizations allow for an in-depth comparison of true and estimated depths across multiple configurations.
